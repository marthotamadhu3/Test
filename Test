Perfect üëç I see what you mean now ‚Äî the manual flow you wrote on the board (image) worked, and only then you were able to access the **private link** for your Postgres Flexible Server.

That means your **automation with Terraform** must replicate *exactly* the same steps:

---

### What your manual steps did (image recap)

1. Create **Postgres instance ‚Üí Networking ‚Üí Private Endpoint**
2. Provide:

   * Subscription
   * Resource group
   * Region
   * Network interface
   * Target sub-resource = `postgresqlServer`
   * Virtual network + Subnet (with dynamic IP)
3. Enable **Integrate with private DNS zone: Yes**

   * DNS zone automatically gets created (`privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com`)
   * A record gets added ‚Üí `<server>.postgres.database.azure.com` ‚Üí Private IP

Only after these DNS records exist inside your VNet, client apps could resolve your Postgres server to the private IP and connect.

### Terraform way to replicate this

You need 3 things automated:

#### 1. Postgres Flexible Server

```hcl
resource "azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server" "db" {
  name                   = "mypgflexserver"
  resource_group_name    = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  location               = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  administrator_login    = "pgadmin"
  administrator_password = "MyStrongPassword123!"
  sku_name               = "B_Standard_B1ms"
  storage_mb             = 32768
  version                = "15"
}
```

---

#### 2. Private Endpoint (maps server to VNet)

```hcl
resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "pg_pe" {
  name                = "mypgflexserver-pe"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.db_subnet.id

  private_service_connection {
    name                           = "pgflex-private-connection"
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server.db.id
    subresource_names              = ["postgresqlServer"]
    is_manual_connection           = false
  }
}
```

---

#### 3. Private DNS Zone (critical for name resolution)

```hcl
resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone" "pg_dns" {
  name                = "privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
}

resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link" "pg_dns_link" {
  name                  = "pg-dns-link"
  resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  private_dns_zone_name = azurerm_private_dns_zone.pg_dns.name
  virtual_network_id    = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.id
}

resource "azurerm_private_dns_a_record" "pg_record" {
  name                = azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server.db.name
  zone_name           = azurerm_private_dns_zone.pg_dns.name
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  ttl                 = 300
  records             = [azurerm_private_endpoint.pg_pe.private_service_connection[0].private_ip_address]
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Result

* Postgres server is created.
* Private Endpoint connects Postgres to your VNet.
* Private DNS Zone ensures `<server>.postgres.database.azure.com` resolves to the **private IP**.

This matches exactly what you did manually ‚Üí so you will be able to access Postgres only via private link.

üëâ Do you want me to prepare a **full Terraform working example** (with VNet + Subnet included) so you can `terraform apply` and get everything (DB + PE + DNS) in one shot?
