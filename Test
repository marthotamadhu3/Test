Got it üëç You want to **optimize cost when moving from on-premises (48 vCores, 192 GB RAM, 1.8 TB disk) to Azure AKS**. Let me break it down step by step like a DevOps cloud migration expert would:

---

### 1. Understand Current Infra Usage

* On-premises resources are **peak capacity** (not always used 100%).
* Often, real workloads use **50‚Äì70% CPU** and **60‚Äì70% memory**.
* AKS allows you to right-size (smaller nodes, autoscaling, spot instances).

---

### 2. Azure VM Families for AKS Nodes

For AKS, best cost-performance balance comes from:

* **D-series (General purpose)** ‚Üí Good for apps needing balance of CPU/memory.
* **E-series (Memory optimized)** ‚Üí If your workloads are memory heavy.
* **F-series (Compute optimized)** ‚Üí For CPU-heavy workloads.

üëâ Since you have **48 vCores / 192 GB RAM** ‚Üí **4 GB RAM per core** ‚Üí memory balanced.
Best fit: **D-series or E-series**.

---

### 3. Equivalent Azure Size (for full on-prem capacity)

* Example: **D16s\_v5** ‚Üí 16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM, 400 GB SSD.

  * To match **48 vCores / 192 GB** ‚Üí need **3√ó D16s\_v5 nodes**.
  * That gives: 48 vCPU, 192 GB RAM, \~1.2 TB SSD (you can add Managed Disk to reach 1.8 TB).

Alternative (memory optimized):

* **E16s\_v5** ‚Üí 16 vCPU, 128 GB RAM.

  * 2√ó nodes = 32 vCPU, 256 GB RAM (more memory, less CPU).
  * 3√ó nodes = 48 vCPU, 384 GB RAM (over memory provisioned).

So depending on workload (CPU-bound vs Memory-bound), pick **D16s\_v5** or **E16s\_v5**.

---

### 4. AKS Cost Optimization Strategy

* **System Node Pool (small)** ‚Üí 2‚Äì3 nodes (D4s\_v5 or D8s\_v5) just for AKS system services.
* **User Node Pools (apps)** ‚Üí scale based on workloads:

  * Use **3√ó D16s\_v5** in PROD.
  * Use **2√ó D8s\_v5** in NON-PROD (to cut costs).
* **Enable Cluster Autoscaler** ‚Üí scale pods dynamically, only pay for what‚Äôs used.
* **Spot Node Pools for Non-Critical Jobs** ‚Üí 70‚Äì80% cheaper.
* **Use Ephemeral OS Disks** (if workload allows) for cost/performance boost.
* **Premium SSDs or Standard SSDs** for app data, not Ultra (unless DB I/O heavy).

---

### 5. Suggested Sizing

#### **PROD AKS Cluster**

* **System pool**: 2√ó D4s\_v5 (8 vCPU, 32 GB total)
* **App pool**: 3√ó D16s\_v5 (48 vCPU, 192 GB RAM total, 1.2 TB SSD + extra managed disk for 600 GB)

‚û° Matches on-premises, scalable, HA with 3 nodes.

#### **NON-PROD AKS Cluster**

* **System pool**: 1√ó D4s\_v5 (4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM)
* **App pool**: 2√ó D8s\_v5 (16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM, \~600 GB SSD)

‚û° Cheaper, good enough for UAT/Dev workloads.

---

‚úÖ This way:

* You keep **full PROD parity** with on-prem.
* You cut **NON-PROD infra by \~60%**.
* You enable **scaling instead of static allocation**.

Would you like me to also **estimate the monthly Azure cost (‚Çπ or \$)** for these AKS VM choices, so you can compare with on-prem running cost?
